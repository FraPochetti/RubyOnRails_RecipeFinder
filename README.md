# Basic Recipe Finder App with Ruby on Rails

I developed this app as part of a weekly assignment for the Coursera Course "Ruby on Rails: an introduction".

The app can be found live here: https://pochetti-f2f-recipe-search.herokuapp.com/?looking_for=pork

Feel free to change the looking_for parameter and explore the recipes retrieved from the Food2Fork API.
